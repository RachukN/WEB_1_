        Vehicle
    </h1>

    <p>
        A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum <sup>[1]</sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include
        wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft
        (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and
        spacecraft.<sup>[2]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
        wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for
        road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup>[3]</sup>
