    <h2>Linear Equations</h2>

    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
    </p>
    <div><samp>ax + b = 0 </samp></div>

    <p>where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are real numbers and <em>x</em> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the
        standard form of a linear
        equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be
        an <em>x</em> so don’t get too locked into always seeing an <em>x</em> there.
    </p>
    <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
    </p>
    <div><samp>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</samp></div>


    <p>where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> are known values and <em>x</em> is the variable or unknown (we don't
        know it yet). Also, <em>a</em> can't be 0.
    </p>
    <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

    <p>π (Pi) times the radius (<em>r</em>) squared:
    </p>

    <div><samp>A = π × r<sup>2</sup> </samp></div>

    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<em>D</em>):
    </p>
    <div>
        <samp>A = π / 4) π D<sup>2</sup> </samp>
    </div>

    <p>
        or, when you know the circumference (<em>C</em>):</p>
    <div>
        <samp> A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 π π </samp>
    </div>
    <h3>Intersection</h3>

    <p>The intersection of two sets <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set of all objects that are
        members of both
        the sets A and B. In symbols,
    </p>

    <var>A ∩ B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B }</var>
    <p>That is, <em>x</em> is an element of the intersection A π B if and only if <em>x</em> is both an element of A and
        an element
        of B.
    </p>
